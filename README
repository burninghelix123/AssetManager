AssetManager.py is a program I created to manage and organize
assets and files either locally on a computer or dynamically on
an SQL server.

This script allows the user to import files and add a variety of properties
and information to them along with custom icons. The asset manager can
either run locally, storing all of the information on your computer,
or dynamically through a SQL database. It has options for opening files
with Maya, Houdini, Nuke, Photoshop, Text Editor, Photo Viewer, and
the default application. It has 8 categories to organize files by and
some basic custom ui options. (Python, PyQt, MySQLdb)

The program can be used in two different ways. The first, locally where
all of the information is stored on the harddisk in either the
installation folder or the current working folder. The second, dynamically
where all of the information is stored on a SQL server and can be shared
and modified by other users.

To connect to a server the user will need to enter a server address, a
database name, a username, and a password.

The following server information is my own personal server provided for
testing purposes. In no way will this server be guarenteed to always be
online or available:
Address:         mysql.bhvfx.com
Database Name:   burninghelix123
Username:        exampleuser123
Password:        password
